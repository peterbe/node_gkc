2) a screen before the first question that says "Starting in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1: GO!"
3) more immediate feedback about closed questions (too late, you got it or he got it)
4) fixing the bugs when it concludes the battle
5) fixing the draw bug by adding an extra question into overtime.

* Open stupid Flash port on EC2 and document it

* In Battle there needs to be an associative array remembering who has

  (if someone removes the readonly attribute and tries again)
